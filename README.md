# GestureControl: Hand Gesture Recognition for Computer Interaction

GestureControl is an early-stage project aimed at developing an application that allows users to control their computer using hand gestures. By leveraging real-time object detection and hand tracking, GestureControl enables intuitive and hands-free interaction with the computer, opening up new possibilities for enhanced user experiences.

## Key Features

- Hand tracking and recognition: Utilizes the power of computer vision to accurately track the user's hand in real time and recognize various hand gestures.
- Mouse control: Translates hand movements into precise mouse movements, enabling users to move the cursor with a simple wave of the hand.
- Click simulation: Allows users to perform mouse clicks by closing their palm or using other defined hand gestures, providing a seamless and natural interaction.
- Calibration and boundary detection: Offers a calibration step to map the edges of the user's screen to the live camera view, ensuring accurate and responsive control. A boundary box is implemented to limit mouse movement within the defined screen area, enhancing precision and usability.
- Gesture-based exit: Provides a built-in gesture to gracefully exit the application, promoting a seamless user experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with GestureControl, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries by running `pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui`.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Run the `gesture_control.py` script.
4. Calibrate the application by following the on-screen instructions.
5. Interact with your computer using hand gestures!

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or newer.
- Webcam or camera input device.

## Future Enhancements

GestureControl is still in its early stages of development. There are several exciting enhancements planned for future iterations, including:

- Advanced gesture recognition: Expand the range of recognized hand gestures to provide users with more control options and enable a wider range of interactions.
- Customization options: Allow users to define and map their own hand gestures to specific actions or shortcuts, empowering them to personalize their experience.
- Integration with other applications: Enable seamless integration with popular software applications, such as video players, presentation tools, or creative software, to provide gesture-based control within specific contexts.
